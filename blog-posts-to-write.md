## My Journey To Learn AI
- Use the tools
- Learn Python
- Learn Data Science
- Learn AI Principles
- Profit?

## Thoughts on Meta's Backend Development Course
- Was OK
- filled some gaps in my knowledge (like normalization of databases)
- A little weird to use Django, but Django is pretty awesome
- Lots of spelling mistakes
- grading other peoples projects made me feel smart and like an idiot at the same time
- Really helped me land my first Python job
- API course was the best and hardest

## What am I doing with my life?
- Losing job, feel like imposter
- might as well do something else
- but I like coding
- might as well get into AI
- but it's a long journey
- try it out for a bit

## I Missed Junior Devs, So I Became a Teacher
- Totally different way to look at code
- Less imposter syndrom when there is more open communication
- Open about what I don't know
- Teachers can learn while they go along
- Webdev is webdev is every language

## Back to Creative Coding
- Once AI journey is complete
- take course in using AI in creative settings
- Crush Kandenze courses
- Make music

## Where Did All The Juniors Go?
- No Junior devs in my last 3 positions
- knowledge 

## Awkward Interview: Nobody Knows Your There
- Construction all around.
- Interview in open eating area cause all rooms were taken

## Awkward Interview: External Examiner
- External examiner

## Awkward Interview: 'Open' Feedback
- 'Open' communication gone horribly wrong

## Awkward Interview: Don't have CV, Don't Know Your Role
- But still trying to access team fit

## Awkward Interview: Code Challenge Complete...ASK ME ABOUT IT
- How are you going to ask me to complete something and not ask me about it?
- WTF was the point? How much wasted work happens at your company?

## Interview Fails: Saying I Want To Be A Competitor
- Last stage with Founder
- Trying to be Radically Candid: said I want to have my own company in the field one day
- Backfired immensely. Fear of IP being stolen
- Oh well

## Interview Fails: Saying There Should Be Private Space For a Team
- Open by default does not mean NO private space
- Psychological safety is important
- 1-on-1s still happen which are (checks notes) private
- 1-on-1s are Sync so your company is not fully async...

## Interview Success: Getting More Than You Asked For
- Calculated what I need to live
- Most company go above that
- Jackpot. 

## Interview Success: Working a Half Day Instead of Full
- In Germany, some companies want a full day of work from you
- You are tired half way through...normal
- Tell them you only have half days available
- Crush the half day and leave

## Awesome Dev Interviews
- Create a CSS specificity calculator
- Program a roomba in React

## AI For Everyone
Take aways from the Deepleaning.AI course
- Three types of AI: ANI, Gen AI, AGI
- - AGI is not making so much progress YET
- AI > Machine learning > deep learning
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks are the used interchangably

## When ML works best
> Anything you can do with 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate. (with mainly ML)

1) Learning a "simple" concept (less than 1 second to do)
2) Lots of data available

## Weakness of ML
- Learning complex concepts from small amounts of data
- perform on new types of data (rotated xray charts)

### Machine Learning Definition
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." - Arthur Samuel
#### Data Science Definition
Science of extracting knowledge and insights from data
- Data Science output can be a slide show :-/
- Glad I didn't get into data science, sounds boring
- Unclear if AI is a part of Data Science or Vice Versa
#### AI Transformation Playbook
1) Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
2) Build an in-house AI team
3) Provide broad AI training
4) Develop AI strategy
5) Develop internal and external communication
