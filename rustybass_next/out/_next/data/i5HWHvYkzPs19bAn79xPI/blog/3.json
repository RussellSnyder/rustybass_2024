Similar to how I got into programming when I realized I could program a computer to play bass lines better than I could, I've decided to get into AI so that I can effectively replace myself in the coming AI job shift. With all the rapid progression, it's not really a question of IF it will happen, but of WHEN. \n\nMy close mentor who taught me a great deal about what I know said that they won't try to transition to AI because they don't think the transition will happen in the next 20 years (out effective software lifetime), but I don't believe it. I don't think general purpose AI will be a thing by the end of this year like some tech bros, but I certainly see it replacing, or **changing** the type of work everyday people do in the next 10 years. But that's for another post... \n\nInitially, I thought about going back to school and found an AI course at CalTech that looked very interesting. But it there would be for several hours of in person (online) classes on Saturday and Sunday and I just couldn't see myself doing that. I have kids and I knew that I could dedicate time when they are at day care or in the evening during the week when they are asleep. I also looked at the course content and saw that one of the 'certificates' that I'd get from the school (from IBM) was also offered on coursera for a fraction of the price! I know myself and I have no problem learning on my own, so I decided it would be the self learning route for me. \n\nOne last note here is that the plan outlined here is also heavily focused on **certificates**. This is because I live in Germany and German companies LOVE certificates. I started taking a very great class on data structures and algorithms from Frontend Masters and stopped because I realised I'd have nothing to put on my CV/Linkedin. I know, I know, the knowledge is what really counts and I fully intend on continuously learning my whole career. That said, to get INTO the career, waving around pieces of paper is what gets companies attention and may be the difference between getting the interview or not.\n\n\nAnd so, without further ado, here is my tentative plan to learn AI over the next few years:\n\n## 1) Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate (about 60 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](lhttps://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer)\n\nWith a background is mainly in web, it makes sense to first learn Python through web. Although I have worked as a full stack developer using PHP, Ruby and C#, I have never worked professionally with Python before taking this course.\n\nI will link a complete review of this course soon, but I want to say that after taking this course (the only thing on my CV that shows I know Python) I applied and was accepted to two different positions as a Python developer. So my initial instinct of certificates being important ended up being true :-) This was great motiviation to continue down my path.\n\n**Completed March 2024**\n\n## 2) AI for Everyone (6 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)\n\nInstead of jumping right into a lengthy course, I wanted to get an overview of the different types of AI to see what I might be interested in. This course is a great introduction\n\nAlthough you can take this course for free, it comes with a certificate for a small fee. As stated earlier, this is important to me as developer in Germany, but you can take the same course for free.\n\nGreat advise about where to use (and not to use) AI as well as the different branches of AI. I was actually considering taking a lengthy course about Data Science before taking this course, but this course helped me understand the difference between Data Science and Machine Learning and that because I ultimately am more interested in building running systems than making spread sheets, being an ML Engineer would be more appropriate for me.\n\n**Completed April 2024**\n\n##  3) The complete OPENAI JS APIs Course - Build 15 Projects  (about 40 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-apis/)\n\nThis course will be one of the only non python courses in this plan. This is because, similar to scientific experiments, sometimes it's best to only have one 'unknown'. Instead of learning ChatGPT with Python (which I'm not such expert with) I chose to learn about it with Node and React because those are the programming languages I best know. I'm fully aware that if I want to be serious getting into AI, I can't stick to javascript, but I so still think building interactive frontends are best with React and I know I can port any of these node backends into Python and use Flask or Django o build an API.\n\nIn addition to removing unknowns, I love these kinds of \"build a bunch of projects\" courses. Not only do you get practical experience with the tools sued in the course, but at the end you can tweek a few projects and slap them on your portfolio to impress your next employer. You can stitch together a couple of the projects and create a totally new thing that you can use to potentially start a business! \n\nThis course I would say is kind of an 'aside' course where I did not intend for it to advance my knowledge of AI, but rather to inform me of what ready made tools can already do (ChatGPT) so that I can reach for that tool when the need arises. \n\n## 4) Generative AI for Software Developers Specialization (IBM - 40 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-ai-for-software-developers)\n\nWith exposure to ChatGPT using javascript in the last course, it's time to switch back to Python and learn about other AI services. With a background in software development, I think I will understand the applications used in this course.\n\n## 5) Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford University & DeepLearning.AI - 80 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)\n\nWith the basics out of the way, an introduction course to AI with Python is in order. This time, with the university of Stanford to give me an alternative prespective.\n\n## 6) IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate (IBM - 80 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)\n\nIt's time to get our hands dirty! This is almost the same certification that I would have gotten attending a Post Graduate course in the US. I expect this to be hard but that at the end, I'll be able to understand AI much better.\n\n## 6a) optional - Deep Learning Specialization (DeepLearning.ai - 120 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)\n\nFrom what I learned in \"AI for Everyone\" course, deep learning (or Neural Networks) is way for patterns to be found in unstructured data (text, videos, images). I find this fascinating and if I don't feel I've learned enough from the IBM certificate's course in Deep Learning, I will take this course as well.\n\n## 7) Computer-Assisted Music in Python (Kadenze - 18 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/computer-assisted-music-in-python-i)\n\nBack to Music! I stumbled upon this course while looking for ways to make music with Python. I have seen EarSketch before, but wanted something that wasn't so connected to the browser. Maybe this is it! It looks similar to what I did with Lisp during my masters.\n\n## 8) Machine Learning for Musicians and Artists (Kadenze - 56 hours) ##\n\n[Link to Course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists)\n\nWith the knoweldge that I've aquired of AI, it's time to see how I can apply it to art! \n\nI am assuming at this point that I have some steady stream of income from my AI knowledge and I can invest in music software like MaxMSP and Ableton.\n\n","imageId":"recipe_learning_ai"},"markdown":"After getting kicked out of 2 jobs in the same year for 'restructuring', it's become painfully obvious to me that AI will be able to either do or drastically reduce the type of development work that I've been doing for the past 10 years.
